# Sump Thing

#### An open sourced approach to aquarium management using the Arduino ESP8266 module
---

## Features

- Open source from front to back
- 4 smart outlets
- 2 thermocouple sensors
- 2 water level sensors
- Built in event tracking
- Full control via wifi from anywhere in the world
- Historical data and analytics tracking

## Why?

The goal is to build something scalable and easy to build so everyone can have sump thing running under their tank.

### Where do I get the hardware?

At this time we are not selling our boards. While we flesh out the software and get out protoype working even better we will continue
planning on building a circuitboard with the esp8266 module built in.

We will update this section as the boards become available.

##  Contributions

At this time we are not accepting contributions outside of our core team, in the future we will open this up.
